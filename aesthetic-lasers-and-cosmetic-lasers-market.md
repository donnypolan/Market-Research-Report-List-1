<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aesthetic Lasers and Cosmetic Lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ablative Lasers</li><li>Non-Ablative Lasers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aesthetic and cosmetic lasers are advanced technologies used for various skin treatments, classified into two main types: ablative and non-ablative lasers. Ablative lasers penetrate the skin more deeply, removing the outer layer to stimulate collagen production and improve skin texture, often used for resurfacing and scar treatment. Non-ablative lasers, on the other hand, target deeper layers without damaging the surface, promoting collagen formation while minimizing recovery time, commonly employed for skin tightening and pigmentation issues. Together, they enhance cosmetic procedures effectively.</p></p>
