<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Coolant Reservoir Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized</li><li>Non-pressurized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive coolant reservoir tank market is categorized into pressurized and non-pressurized types. Pressurized coolant reservoirs are designed to withstand high-temperature and pressure conditions, helping to maintain optimal coolant flow and prevent boiling. They often feature a cap that regulates pressure, enhancing system efficiency. In contrast, non-pressurized coolant reservoirs operate at atmospheric pressure, typically found in simpler cooling systems. They allow coolant expansion and contraction but may be less efficient in high-performance applications. Both types serve essential roles in vehicle temperature regulation.</p></p>
