<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airbag Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sensor</li><li>Passive Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive airbag sensor market comprises two main types: active sensors and passive sensors. Active sensors continuously monitor parameters like vehicle acceleration and impact force, allowing for real-time data analysis to deploy airbags more effectively during a collision. Conversely, passive sensors remain dormant until triggered by specific criteria, such as sudden deceleration. Both sensor types play critical roles in enhancing vehicle safety, ensuring timely airbag deployment, and ultimately reducing injury risks in crash scenarios.</p></p>
