<p><strong>The Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)</li><li>Interferon Gamma Released Assay (IGRA)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) testing market includes two primary types: Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). TST involves intradermal injection of purified protein derivative to detect immune response, resulting in a swelling at the injection site. IGRA, a blood test, measures immune response to specific TB antigens. While TST is cost-effective and widely used, IGRA offers higher specificity, particularly for individuals with a history of vaccination or those with compromised immune systems.</p></p>
